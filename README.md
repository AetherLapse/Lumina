# Discord Custom Theme

This is a custom theme for Discord that revamps the visual appearance of the Discord UI. It was created by editing some of pre-build themes(Frosted Glass) hope you will like it.

## Installation

To use this theme, you will need an extension that allows for custom CSS injection on Discord. We recommend using BetterDiscord or BandagedBD for this purpose.

1.  Install BetterDiscord ([click here](https://betterdiscord.app/) for installation instructions) or BandagedBD ([click here](https://rauenzi.github.io/BBDInstaller/) for installation instructions) for your appropriate operating system.
2.  Once installed, open Discord and navigate to User Settings > BetterDiscord (or BandagedBD) > Plugins.
3.  Click the "Open plugins folder" button to open a file explorer window. Create a new folder named "themes" if it does not already exist.
4.  Download the `lumina-theme.css` file provided in this repository and place it in the "themes" folder.
5.  Restart Discord and navigate to User Settings > BetterDiscord (or BandagedBD) > Themes.
6.  Select "lumina-theme" from the themes dropdown menu and click "Save".
7.  Discord will now reload and the custom theme should be applied.
